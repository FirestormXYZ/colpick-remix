# Colpick RemiX
Photoshop-like jQuery Color Picker plugin with various skins and layouts, touch, and responsive. <br>

# IMPORTANT
<b> This is only a prototype of the plugin with the support of alpha channel! <br>
I've added the bar of alpha channel and the inputbox of alpha value, but they currently do nothing... apart from changing the value of alpha in the inputbox! </b>

### Changes from PV4 to PV5
1. Completed Small and Extra-Large layouts!
2. Now, if alpha is disabled, the max-lenght of the hex field will be reduced to 6.
3. Optimizations and bugfix.
