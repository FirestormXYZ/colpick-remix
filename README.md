# Colpick RemiX
Photoshop-like jQuery Color Picker plugin with various skins and layouts, touch, and responsive. <br>

# IMPORTANT
<b> This is only a prototype of the plugin with the support of alpha channel! <br>
I've added the bar of alpha channel and the inputbox of alpha value, but they currently do nothing... apart from changing the value of alpha in the inputbox! <br>
And... I've completed only the standard layout! </b>

### Changes from PV1 to PV2
1. Added a checkerboard behind the 2, new and current, colors.
2. Improved internal structure of alpha bar.
3. Fixed the new layout of the submit button.
